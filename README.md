# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my structured practice of Data Structures and Algorithms, including:

- Core data structures
- Algorithm implementations
- Common problem-solving patterns
- Interview-style problems
- Optimized and readable solutions

## Goals
- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews

## Languages
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- (Add more as needed)

## Structure
- `data-structures/` – Core DS implementations
- `algorithms/` – Algorithm categories
- `problems/` – Practice problems by platform and difficulty
- `patterns/` – Reusable problem-solving patterns
- `notes/` – Theory, complexity, and tips
